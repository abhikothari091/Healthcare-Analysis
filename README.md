## Introduction
Predicting the length of patient stay is a critical task for efficient hospital management. This project applies neural network models to predict patient stay duration based on various features. The model helps in anticipating the hospital's resource requirements and optimizing patient flow.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to patient demographics, medical history, and hospital stay details. For privacy reasons, the actual dataset cannot be shared publicly.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- tensorflow or keras
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-analysis-project.git
cd healthcare-analysis-project
```

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Healthcare_notebook.ipynb
```

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Modeling Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Using SMOTE to balance the dataset.
3. **Neural Network Model**: Building and optimizing neural network architectures.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuning the model parameters for better performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Reverse Transformation**: Transforming the scaled predictions back to their original scale for interpretability.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 49.75%. The model's predictions can help healthcare providers manage resources more efficiently and improve patient care.
